# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest Scope

The contest will focus on Axelar's gateway smart contracts that are deployed on EVM chains
that process messages generated from the Axelar network (such as minting a certain token),
and accept messages/token deposits from users/applications.

# Protocol overview

Axelar is a decentralized interoperability network connecting all blockchains, assets and apps through a universal set of protocols and APIs.
It is built on top off the Cosmos SDK. Users/Applications can use Axelar network to send tokens between any Cosmos and EVM chains. They can also
send arbitrary messages between EVM chains.

Axelar network's decentralized validators confirm events emitted on EVM chains (such as deposit confirmation and message send),
and sign off on commands submitted (by automated services) to the gateway smart contracts (such as minting token, and approving message on the destination).

A detailed design can be found here: https://docs.axelar.dev/roles/dev/design

# Areas to focus

We'd like wardens to particularly focus on the following:

1. General message passing: `sendToken`, `contractCallWithToken`, and `contractCall`.
2. Mints/burns for token transfers.
3. Authentication of commands: `execute` in `AxelarGatewayMultisig.sol`.

Note: `AxelarGatewaySinglesig.sol` can be ignored as it's the same as `AxelarGatewayMultisig.sol` but designed to work with a single signature (when using threshold signature schemes).
